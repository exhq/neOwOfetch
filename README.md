NeOwOfetch is a shitty command-line system information tool written in `go`. NeOwOfetch displays information that you'd never want to know, software and hardware in an extremely cringe and not pleasing way.

The overall purpose of NeOwOfetch is to be used as a laughing stock. NeOwOfetch shows the information other people would have no fucking reason to see. There are so many better tools yet you decided to use this shitty bs

The information by default is displayed alongside your operating system's uwuified logo. You can further configure NeOwOfetch to instead use your shitty images or asciiarts, but ngl im too lazy and havent implemented it yet

You can further configure NeOwOfetch to your horrible taste. Through the use of command-line flags and idfk i havent implemented it yet.

Neofetch supports almost like 2 different operating systems. From Linux to Linux. If your favourite operating system is unsupported i dont give a shit, ill get to it when i get to it. for now its just arch and ubuntu
